==== BUGS ====
- onAttack: If a player is missing on an attack but also has flaming weapon, the flaming weapon damage will still hit the target 
given the order the spells were cast (if flamingWeapon conditionEffect is executed before the missing)

- getUnitsInFreeRange: The min-range of getUnitsInFreeRange function does not work

- when there are more than one damage type applied at the same time (e.g. slash (Warrior)) the text size should automatically change to fit it better.
    - Also check if the opponent is immune (e.g. damage = 0) and it is being hit by slash

- NPC's doesn't work with cooldowns... (Zombies)

- Purgatory p2

- While walking to a teleport you can press T to kind of duplicate your character


==== TODO ====
- Fix upgrade to new class functionalities
- Add the misc shop
- Add more items
- Combine items
- Get set bonus on items
- Add more enemies and waves of enemies
- Add spell animations etc...
- Add PvP
- Add PvE


=== IDEAS ====
- Let totems and summons have the spell category, so they can learn new spells depending on how long they survive!
