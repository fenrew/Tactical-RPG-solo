==== BUGS ====
- onAttack: If a player is missing on an attack but also has flaming weapon, the flaming weapon damage will still hit the target 
given the order the spells were cast (if flamingWeapon conditionEffect is executed before the missing)

- 0 damage visuals: If a person is disarmed and uses Joint strike the damage does not apear on the target but 0 dmg is appearing 
on the caster

- Unit dies: Remove combatEffects from dead units. This gives an error otherwise with the animations/visual

- getUnitsInFreeRange: The min-range of getUnitsInFreeRange function does not work

- if a player dies from a dot it causes an error:
update-initiation-visuals.js:26 Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'playerNumber' of undefined
    at updatePlayerPanelActiveTurn (update-initiation-visuals.js:26)
    at GameClass._nextTurn (Game.js:152)

=== IDEAS ====
- Let totems and summons have the spell category, so they can learn new spells depending on how long they survive!
